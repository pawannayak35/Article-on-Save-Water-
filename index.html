                 Water is the precious gift of God on the earth. Life exists on the earth because of the availability of water. 
				 Itself being tasteless, odorless and colorless, it adds taste, color and nice smell in the life of living beings on the earth. 
				 It is found everywhere and known as life. It takes nothing from us but gives life to us. 
				 It has no shape but takes the shape of container we store it. We find it everywhere in rivers, seas, tanks, wells, 
				 ponds, etc but we lack clean drinking water. Three-fourth part of the earth is full of water however we need to 
				 conserve water as there is very less percentage of clean water.
				 Importance of Clean Water
                 Without water life is not possible on the earth. All the living beings like human, animals, plants, etc need water to grow, 
				 develop and live. Water is the only source of all lives here. We need water in all the walks of life from morning till night 
				 like drinking, cooking, bathing, washing clothes, watering plant, etc.People working in different fields need water for different
				 purposes such as farmers need water to grow crops, gardeners to water plants, industrialists for industry work, electricity plants to
				 generate hydro-electricity, etc. So, we should save clean water for the wellness of our future generations and healthy life of water 
				 and wildlife animals. People at many places of the world are suffering water scarcity or completely lack of water in their regions.
